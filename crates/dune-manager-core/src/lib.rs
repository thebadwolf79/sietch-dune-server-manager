//! Core orchestration and CLI support for the Dune dedicated server manager.
//!
//! This crate intentionally contains no Tauri or UI code. It owns the
//! Windows/Hyper-V setup orchestration, guest SSH bootstrap flow, Kubernetes
//! battlegroup operations, managed external tool installation, and the
//! non-interactive CLI used to exercise those capabilities.
